# Restaurant One Solution Project

## Overview
Restaurant One Solution is a comprehensive data analysis solution developed to manage and optimize restaurant operations. This project utilizes Excel for initial data management and Alteryx for advanced analytics and workflow automation. The solution covers various aspects of restaurant management, including client details, restaurant information, user data, orders, dine-in and delivery specifics, cash ups, banking info, expenses, sales, tax info, third-party info, product details, subscriptions, roles, departments, and currency.

## Features
- **Data Management**: Excel was used for organizing and cleaning data related to clients, restaurants, orders, and financial transactions. This included managing client activation status, restaurant details, user information, and order specifics like food and drink amounts, service charges, and delivery details.
- **Automated Workflows**: Alteryx was leveraged to create sophisticated workflows and automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. This included automating the processing of cash ups, tracking sales and expenses, and reconciling banking information.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: KPIs were established to measure and drive performance improvements. Targets included increasing profit by 15% over the next two quarters, achieving a 0% error rate in accounting, boosting takeaway profitability by 10%, acquiring five new clients within three months, and reducing turnaround time for cash up and banking processes.

## Workflows
- **Order Placement**: Managed by customers.
- **Delivery**: Handled by partners.
- **Cash Ups**: Processed and published to the finance team.
- **Banking**: Reconciliation of cash up amounts.
