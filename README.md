## Overview
Restaurant One Solution is a comprehensive data analysis solution developed to manage and optimize restaurant operations. This project combines the capabilities of Excel for foundational data management and Alteryx for advanced analytics and workflow automation. It covers various aspects of restaurant management, including client details, restaurant information, user data, orders, dine-in and delivery specifics, cash ups, banking info, expenses, sales, tax info, third-party info, product details, subscriptions, roles, departments, and currency.

## Project Description
In this project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis solution for managing and optimizing restaurant operations using Excel and Alteryx. The project involved a detailed dataset encompassing various aspects of restaurant management, including:

- Client Details
- Restaurant Information
- User Data
- Orders (Dine-in and Delivery specifics)
- Cash Ups
- Banking Info
- Expenses
- Sales
- Tax Info
- Third-Party Info
- Product Details
- Subscriptions
- Roles
- Departments
- Currency

## Features
- **Data Management**: Organize and clean data related to clients, restaurants, orders, and financial transactions.
- **Automated Workflows**: Create sophisticated workflows and automate ETL processes.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Establish targets to measure and drive performance improvements.
- **Visualization**: Develop dashboards and reports for insightful data visualization.
- **Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Excel Utilization
Excel was utilized initially for foundational data management. It was essential for organizing and cleaning data related to clients, restaurants, orders, and financial transactions. This included managing client activation status, restaurant details, user information, and order specifics like food and drink amounts, service charges, and delivery details. Excel's functionalities allowed for preliminary data analysis, report generation, and trend identification, providing a solid base for further analysis.

### Key Tasks in Excel
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
2. **Data Organization**: Structuring data into tables and applying filters for easy navigation.
3. **Preliminary Analysis**: Generating pivot tables and charts to identify initial trends and patterns.
4. **Reporting**: Creating summary reports to provide an overview of key metrics and performance indicators.

## Alteryx Implementation
Transitioning to Alteryx, the project advanced with the creation of sophisticated workflows and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Alteryx’s advanced capabilities enabled the development of automated data workflows to streamline the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. This included automating the processing of cash ups, tracking sales and expenses, and reconciling banking information.

### Key Tasks in Alteryx
1. **Data Integration**: Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
2. **ETL Processes**: Automating data extraction, transformation, and loading to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
3. **Workflow Automation**: Designing workflows to handle repetitive tasks and improve efficiency.
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms for deeper insights.
5. **KPI Tracking**: Monitoring key performance indicators to measure success and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs were established to measure and drive performance improvements. These KPIs included targets such as:

- Increasing profit by 15% over the next two quarters
- Achieving a 0% error rate in accounting
- Boosting takeaway profitability by 10%
- Acquiring five new clients within three months
- Reducing turnaround time for cash up and banking processes

### List of KPIs
1. **Profit Increase**: Measure overall profit growth.
2. **Accounting Accuracy**: Track error rates in financial records.
3. **Takeaway Profitability**: Analyze profitability from takeaway orders.
4. **Client Acquisition**: Monitor the number of new clients acquired.
5. **Turnaround Time**: Measure the time taken for cash up and banking processes.

## Workflows in Alteryx
Workflows designed in Alteryx covered critical processes such as order placement by customers, delivery by partners, publication of cash ups to the finance team, banking of cash up amounts, and subscription purchases by clients. These workflows facilitated a seamless and integrated approach to managing restaurant operations.

### Workflow Examples
1. **Order Placement**: Automate the recording and tracking of customer orders.
2. **Delivery Management**: Streamline the process of assigning and tracking deliveries.
3. **Cash Ups**: Automate the process of recording and reconciling daily cash ups.
4. **Banking Reconciliation**: Ensure accurate reconciliation of bank transactions.
5. **Subscription Management**: Automate the management of client subscriptions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-one-solution.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd restaurant-one-solution
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Adjust the command if your setup requires different dependencies)

## Usage
- Run the application and workflows to analyze data and optimize restaurant operations.
- Utilize Excel for initial data management and Alteryx for advanced analytics to achieve business goals.

### Running the Workflows
1. Open Alteryx Designer.
2. Load the workflow files from the project directory.
3. Configure the data sources and outputs as needed.
4. Run the workflows to process and analyze the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Excel**: For data organization, cleaning, preliminary analysis, and report generation.
- **Alteryx**: For automated workflows, advanced analytics, and KPI tracking.
- **Python**: For custom data processing scripts.
- **SQL**: For database management and querying.
- **Tableau/Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from various sources, including internal restaurant management systems, third-party delivery partners, and financial institutions. Key data sources include:

- **Client Management System**: Provides client details and activation status.
- **Order Management System**: Records order specifics, including food and drink amounts, service charges, and delivery details.
- **Financial System**: Tracks cash ups, banking information, expenses, sales, and tax info.
- **Third-Party Systems**: Includes data from delivery partners and product suppliers.

## Data Processing
Data processing involves several key steps to ensure data quality and readiness for analysis:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
2. **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
3. **Data Transformation**: Apply transformations to prepare data for analysis, such as aggregations and calculations.

### Example: Data Cleaning Script
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load raw data
raw_data = pd.read_csv('data/raw/orders.csv')

# Remove duplicates
clean_data = raw_data.drop_duplicates()

# Handle missing values
clean_data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Save processed data
clean_data.to_csv('data/processed/orders_clean.csv', index=False)
```

## Visualization
Data visualization is crucial for deriving insights and communicating findings. This project uses tools like Tableau and Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports.

### Example: KPI Dashboard
The KPI dashboard provides a visual representation of key performance indicators, allowing stakeholders to quickly assess performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Analysis
In-depth analysis is performed to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that drive decision-making. This includes:

- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends in sales, expenses, and customer behavior.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Analyzing profitability across different channels and time periods.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluating the

 performance of different departments and roles.

### Example: Profitability Analysis Script
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load processed data
data = pd.read_csv('data/processed/sales_clean.csv')

# Calculate profitability
data['profit'] = data['revenue'] - data['cost']

# Group by channel
profit_by_channel = data.groupby('channel')['profit'].sum()

# Save results
profit_by_channel.to_csv('reports/profit_by_channel.csv')
```
