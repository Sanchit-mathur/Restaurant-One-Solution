## Overview
Restaurant One Solution is a comprehensive data analysis solution designed to manage and optimize restaurant operations. This project leverages Excel for foundational data management and Alteryx for advanced analytics and workflow automation. It addresses various aspects of restaurant management, including client details, restaurant information, user data, orders, cash ups, banking info, expenses, sales, tax info, third-party info, product details, subscriptions, roles, departments, and currency.

## Project Description
The project involves developing a data analysis solution for managing and optimizing restaurant operations using Excel and Alteryx. It includes a detailed dataset covering:

- Client Details
- Restaurant Information
- User Data
- Orders (Dine-in and Delivery specifics)
- Cash Ups
- Banking Info
- Expenses
- Sales
- Tax Info
- Third-Party Info
- Product Details
- Subscriptions
- Roles
- Departments
- Currency

## Features
- **Data Management**: Organize and clean data related to clients, restaurants, orders, and financial transactions.
- **Automated Workflows**: Create sophisticated workflows and automate ETL processes.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Establish targets to measure and drive performance improvements.
- **Visualization**: Develop dashboards and reports for insightful data visualization.
- **Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis to identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

## Excel Utilization
Excel was initially used for foundational data management, including:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
2. **Data Organization**: Structuring data into tables and applying filters for easy navigation.
3. **Preliminary Analysis**: Generating pivot tables and charts to identify initial trends and patterns.
4. **Reporting**: Creating summary reports to provide an overview of key metrics and performance indicators.

## Alteryx Implementation
In Alteryx, the project advanced with sophisticated workflows and KPI tracking:

1. **Data Integration**: Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
2. **ETL Processes**: Automating data extraction, transformation, and loading to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. **Workflow Automation**: Designing workflows for repetitive tasks to improve efficiency.
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms for deeper insights.
5. **KPI Tracking**: Monitoring key performance indicators to measure success and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs were established to measure and drive performance improvements, including:

1. **Profit Increase**: Measure overall profit growth.
2. **Accounting Accuracy**: Track error rates in financial records.
3. **Takeaway Profitability**: Analyze profitability from takeaway orders.
4. **Client Acquisition**: Monitor the number of new clients acquired.
5. **Turnaround Time**: Measure the time taken for cash up and banking processes.

## Workflows in Alteryx
Workflows designed in Alteryx include:

1. **Order Placement**: Automate recording and tracking of customer orders.
2. **Delivery Management**: Streamline the process of assigning and tracking deliveries.
3. **Cash Ups**: Automate recording and reconciling daily cash ups.
4. **Banking Reconciliation**: Ensure accurate reconciliation of bank transactions.
5. **Subscription Management**: Automate management of client subscriptions.

### Running the Workflows
1. Open Alteryx Designer.
2. Load the workflow files from the project directory.
3. Configure data sources and outputs as needed.
4. Run the workflows to process and analyze the data.

## Technologies Used
- **Excel**: For data management, cleaning, and preliminary analysis.
- **Alteryx**: For advanced analytics, workflow automation, and KPI tracking.

## Project Structure
The project structure includes:

- **Data Files**: Organized into folders for client details, orders, financial data, etc.
- **Workflows**: Alteryx workflows for various data processing tasks.
- **Reports**: Excel reports and dashboards for visualization and analysis.

## Data Sources
The data comes from various sources, including:

- **Client Management System**: Provides client details and activation status.
- **Order Management System**: Records order specifics, including food and drink amounts, service charges, and delivery details.
- **Financial System**: Tracks cash ups, banking information, expenses, sales, and tax info.
- **Third-Party Systems**: Includes data from delivery partners and product suppliers.

## Data Processing
Data processing includes:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
2. **Data Integration**: Combining data from multiple sources into a unified dataset.
3. **Data Transformation**: Applying transformations to prepare data for analysis, such as aggregations and calculations.

## Visualization
Data visualization tools, like Excel, are used to create interactive dashboards and reports.

### Example: KPI Dashboard
The KPI dashboard visually represents key performance indicators, allowing stakeholders to quickly assess performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Analysis
In-depth analysis includes:

- **Trend Analysis**: Identifying trends in sales, expenses, and customer behavior.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Analyzing profitability across different channels and time periods.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluating performance against established KPIs.

## Challenges
Key challenges addressed in the project:

- **Orders Data Generation**: Implementing a system to automatically generate and simulate order data.
- **Relation Between Cash Up & Banking Info**: Analyzing and reconciling the relationship between cash up records and banking transactions.
- **KPI Tracking**: Establishing and accurately tracking meaningful KPIs.

## Future Work
Future enhancements could include:

- **Additional KPIs**: Expanding the set of KPIs to cover more aspects of restaurant operations.
- **Integration with New Systems**: Incorporating data from new systems and expanding the scope of analysis.

By integrating Excel and Alteryx, this project enhances data analysis and reporting capabilities, resulting in improved decision-making and operational efficiency for restaurant management. The combination of foundational data management in Excel and advanced analytics in Alteryx provides a comprehensive solution for optimizing restaurant performance and achieving business goals.
